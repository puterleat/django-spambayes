Installation
============

Dependencies
------------

Django-SpamBayes requires the core SpamBayes package. This does not include
any of the specialized e-mail client plugins. It is recommended that you
download and install a recent "source release" of SpamBayes.

    wget http://voxel.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/spambayes/spambayes-1.1a4.tar.gz
    tar zxvf spambayes-1.1a4.tar.gz
    cd spambayes-1.1a4
    python setup.py install



There are three ways to install Django-SpamBayes:

Easy Install
