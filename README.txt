Django-SpamBayes
================

Django-SpamBayes includes a few utility apps for [Django][] that offer an 
easy to use interface to the [SpamBayes][] statistical anti-spam filter 
allowing filtering and moderation (with training) of comments, contact 
forms and other publicly submitted data.

For instalation instructions see the file ``INSTALL.txt`` and for 
documentation see the files in the ``docs\`` directory.

The latest version of these documents (and code) can be found on the 
Google Code project page at <http://code.google.com/p/django-spambayes/>.
